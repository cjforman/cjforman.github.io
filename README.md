A simple javascript app to show how the way money is created leads to economic disparity.

It works by creating a pile of cubes that is raw material.

Each agent in the simulation tries to build the tallest tower it can from the cubes.  This represents personal wealth. 

Cubes are colored according to who owns them. Thus agents can build towers out of cubes owned by other agents. 

Each agent can only add one cube per cycle to their tower, which deletes cubes from the general repository.  Or they can help to build someone elses tower 

They can borrow cubes from other agents but instead of adding their work cube to their tower they pay the agent back that loaned the cubes. 

The total amount of money in the economy is represented by the height of the towers. 

If the universal repository is depleted below 50% everyone dies.
